CSC 249 Project 2 
Due October 11 2024
Zoe Plumridge 

A text (.txt or .md) document with a written description of your client-VPN message format 
(that is, a description of all implemented client and VPN messages, 
and how the various components of each message are represented). 
Your goal in writing this document should be to convey enough information 
in enough detail to allow a competent programmer 
without access to your source code 
to write either a new client that communicates properly with your VPN server, 
or a new VPN server that communicates properly with your client. 
This document should include at least six sections: 
Overview of Application, 
Client->VPN Server Message Format, 
VPN Server->Client Message Format, 
Example Output, 
a description of how the network layers are interacting when you run your server, 
VPN server, 
and client, 
and Acknowledgments.

Instructions for operation / what happens
1. Run each of client, VPN, server
2. Client says: Enter target message: 
Target message is a string. Prefered format is "integer" "message", 
but if no integer is provided, or if the integer is 20 or greater, the program defaults to 5. 
Client adds the information of the target server to the beginning of the message. 
Client sends this to VPN.

VPN splits information into server IP, server host, and message. 
VPN then forwards the information to the server while continuing to maintain a connection with the client. 

Server receives information, processes, sends back to VPN. 

VPN receives information from server, forwards to client.

Client receives information. Closes connections. 

Application repeats "integer" number of times the message converted to all capital letters.
